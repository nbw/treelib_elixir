# History

The website was [original](https://github.com/nbw/treelib) written in [ Ruby // Sinatra // MySQL // React ] between 2015-2016. It's all hand rolled with "caching" (sort of), SQL, a db client, etc.. It works really well actually, but I've been inspired to rewrite it in Elixir so that it's more maintainable and stable.
