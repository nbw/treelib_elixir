# Treelib 

[Treelib](http://treelib.ca) in [ Elixir 1.5 // Phoenix 1.3 // MySQL // React ]

TreeLib is a dendrology website with curated high-quality tree photographs for educators, students and lay persons. It uses Flickr (with their API) as a CDN for images.

The website was original written in [ Ruby // Sinatra // MySQL // React ] between 2015-2016. It's all hand rolled with "caching" (sort of), SQL, a db client, etc.. It works really well actually, but I've been inspired to rewrite it in Elixir so that it's more maintainable and stable.
